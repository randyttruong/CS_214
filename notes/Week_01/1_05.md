**Notes for Thursday, January 5, 2023 (Lecture 1/25)** 

"Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about the data structures and their relationships." 

# Data Structures 
1. Fundamental when writing any non-trivial programs 

2. What is a data structure? 
	1. A scheme for organizing data, to use it efficiently. 
	2. Composed of two parts: 
		1. Representation 
			- The mapping of the conceptual pieces of the data to concrete building blocks
		2. Operations 
			- How a client can access and manipulate these conceptual pieces 
	3. Motivation for Data Structures 
		1. Correctness 
			1. Making sure that every operation can fulfill their goals 
		2. Efficiency 
			1. Time 
				1. Speed 
			2. Space
				1. Low amounts of memory 
			3. Locality 
				1. Efficient power usage, etc.

	NOTE: Data structures are all about compromises, since we will always be trading one of these elements
	for another element.
		1. It is often impossible to meet all of their goals 100% 
		2. Different data structures possess different tradeoffs

## Abstract Data Type 
1. A class of abstract objects which is completely characterized by the operations available on those objects 
	- Barbara Liskov, who invented the concept of the abstract data type at CMU 

2. Group of data structures that can serve the same role 	
	1. You can choose a data structure or another based on which tradeoffs are best for your situation 
	2. Can switch between them as your needs change 

3. Example 
	1. Let's say that we want to use sets of integers in our program
		1. We want to be able to insert new integers into sets 
		2. And check whether a given integer is in the set 
	2. "Sets" in this case, are an ADT 
	3. Representation 
		1. Set elements = vector elements 
		2. Operations / Methods 
			1. Insertion()  - Inserting elements inside of the vector (by creating a new vector and copying it) 
			2. Membership() - Checking whether or not an element is in the set (by iterating through it 
			and comparing) 
				1. Invariants - a rule that must hold true in our data structure 
4. Example 2: Sorted set elements 
	1. Operations / Methods 
		1. Insertion 
		2. Membership

5. Example 3: Linked List 
	1. Representation 
		1. Set elements are represented by linked list elements / nodes 

	2. Operations 
		1. Insertion()  - Literally just add a new node - O(1) time complexity 
		2. Membership() - Just loop through the list, checking each element 
6. Tradeoffs
	1. Notice how if we only care about membership, the sorted array is best
	2. Otherwise, if we want to insert new elements, the linked list is best 

==================================================

# Zooming Out 
1. Goals of this class 
	1. An introduction to what data structures are out there 
		1. Not exhaustive, but an overview 
		2. Increasing "programming vocabulary" 
		3. Making informed choices of ADTs and DSs
	
	2. Zooming out in programming 
		1. 111/150/211 focus on the details of programming 
			1. Functions, conditionals, loops, etc.
			2. The building blocks, not actually the great scope of actual programming 
		2. 214 
			1. Works with larger building blocks: DSs and ADTs 
			2. "Bigger picture" concerns 
				1. Instead of just "finding the right answer," we care about: 
					1. Efficiency
					2. Modularity
					3. Maintanability 

		3. 300-level classes require you to think at this level 

# Course Philosophy 
1. Learning comes first 
	1. Last stop before 300-level classes / internships 
	2. Custom grading system to emphasize learning over grades
	 	1. Qualitative, no weighted averages/curves 
		2. Read syllabus 
	3. Goals: 	
		1. Reduce stress
		2. Producing the best work 
		3. Addressing issues with traditional grading methods 
2. Low Stakes
	1. Room to learn from mistakes (wherever possible) 
		1. Assignments: feedback + resubmissions 
	2. Bounded impact 
		1. You won't fail the class just for bombing an exam 
	3. FLexibility for everyone, built-in
		1. No questions asked, no need to ask 
		2. Late tokens, multiple paths to success, etc. 
3. High Expectations 
	1. One doesn't learn by producing so-so work 
		1. Failing this class is through producing so-so work 
	2. Heads up: High grades have a high bar 
		1. This is intentional 

4. Resubmissions, not partial credit 
	1. Half-broken work generally means partial credit in other classes
	2. If the code is half-broken in this class, you will get NO credit, just fix the code
		1. Good concepts/habits to learn 
		2. Ability to achieve full credit 
5. Transparency 
	1. Grading mechanisms, expectations, etc. are all stated up front. 
	2. No surprises
		if you're headed for trouble, you can see it coming 
			1. Just follow the tables in the syllabus 
			2. You need to be paying attention, though
	3. Control 
		1. My grade is all of my work 
		2. No curves, no cutoffs, etc. 
6. Success
	1. Today
		1. Read the syllabus, in full 
	2. Before lecture
		1. Read textbook chapter, skim slides 
	3. During lecture
	4. After lecture
	5. Assignments

7. Communication channels 
	1. Lectures 
	2. Canvas
	3. Piazza
	4. Office hours 
	5. Email

8. Classroom Etiquette
 	1. Focus and concentration
	2. Chill and do non-lecture stuff in the back 
	3. No side-conversations 
	4. Ask questions, don't ask your neighbor 
	5. Come into the classroom quietly if you come early/late 

9. No cheating 
	1. Literally just looking at someone else's work is bad 

==================================================

# Lecture 
1. The language: DSSL2 
	1. Data Structures Student Language (version 2) 
2. Class cousin of Python 
	1. If you know Python, you know DSSL2 
	2. If you know DSSL2, you know Python
3. Why not Python? 
	1. It has batteries included
	2. We wouldn't be able to learn the data strucutres we need to learn 
	3. We want to learn about the building blocks, and Python already has them built-in 
		1. Arrays  

# DSSL2 Notes 
1. You have to declare the variables 
	1. let x = 5 
		1. After all, if we did x = 5, there is an assumption that x already exists 
	2. Indentation matters 
		1. Grouping of blocks/indentation
		2. COMP_SCI 231 (Programming Languages) 
	3. Errors 
		1. error('some string')
	4. Testing and asserts 
		"Programming without tests is like running around with a blindfold and a blowtorch" - Prem Seetharaman

		1. test {'some string'} - (creates a "test" object with a name) 
		2. assert {some expression} - (asserts what the answer for a function should be) 
		
		NOTE: The expectation is that we create our own tests in this class
		3. If a test fails, the test block is nulled, then the execution continues 
		4. Watch the videos on canvas 

# Creating a DSSL2 Program 
1. #lang dssl2 
	1. Header 

# What are Data Structures Made Of? 
1. Ultimately 
	1. Bits and bytes (COMP_SCI 213)
2. Conceptually 
	1. Boxes
		1. Arrays/Vectors -- facilitators for the data structure 
		2. Note, boxes are their own instances, we assign them to different names/identities
		3. Aliases 
			1. Just making two elements point to the same box 
				1. Watch out, they can be very prone to bugs 

	2. Arrows
		1. Method of connecting boxes 
		2. Implicit 
		3. Literally just pointers that are built into the programming language 
			1. Different from using C/C++, in which we make pointers ourselves 

	1. Vectors 
		1. Sequences of data 
		2. Are indexed 
		3. Have instantaneous access times 
			- Constant time complexity 
		4. Might have fixed size - Static array 

		Example: 
		[15, 10145, 3] 
		["red", "yellow", "puce", "brown", "black", "purple"] 

		5. Syntax in DSSL2 
		
			let v = [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ] 

		6. Methods: 
			1. [] - access element at desired index 
			2. .len() - show vectorl ength 

		7. Vector Comprehensions 
			1. Allow you to create a vector using a description rather than literal elements 
			2. Example 
				[ 0; 100000 ] 

			3. Example Notes
				1. Creates a vector with '100000' elements, all '0' 
				2. Can be more complex, just follows the Pythonic syntax 

	2. Structs (also known as classes that just don't have any methods/functions) 
		1. Collections of data 
			1. Possess different instance variables (and are accessed by these variable names) 
			2. Have O(1) time complexity 
		2. Literally just work like python classes 
	3. Classes
		1. Just python classes
			1. Just remember to __init__ as well as (self)! 

3. Vectors vs Structs 
	1. If you can name different *fields* or *characteristics* of the concept, use a struct 
	2. If it's just a random collection of data, use an array/vector, since all elements are the "same"  

4. Contracts 
	1. Not a statically-typed language, however, static types can be extremely useful 
	2. Example 
		
		def add_elt (x: int?, i: nat?)...
