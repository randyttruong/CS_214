**Data Structures Day 2: Linked Lists 1/10/23** 

# Notes 
1. Think of edge cases before even writing the code  

# Linked Lists Lecture 
1. Motivation 
	1. We can't use normal vectors/arrays for everythign since they are static 
		1. We cannot add elements without removing them 
		2. Therefore, the only strategy we can employ is just copying  the entire array into another array 
2. Analogy
	1. Think of each book as an individual novel PLUS a clue to what the next book is going to be 
3. Definition
	1. An alternative data structure which is still going to fulfill the same purpose of collecting elements in a particular order
		1. Instead of having a single vector, however, we are going to have numerous different structs that have their own 
		value on top of a pointer to the next struct 
4. The class itself 
	1. Node class (AKA cons) 
		1. Instance Variables
			1. Data/value 
			2. Next
		2. Methods 
		3. Characteristics
			1. Remember that the tail of a linked list 
			will have an empty 'next' pointer 
	2. The linkedList class 
		1. Instance Variables
			1. Header 
                        2. Length 
                        3. Tail 
		2. Methods 
			1. Insert
			2. Remove
				1. Remember to deallocate memory 
		3. Headerless vs Headerful lists 
			1. Graphs <- headerless linked lists are fine 
			2. Standalone Data Structures <- headers are 
			required
5. Instance varaibles 
	1. data / value <- the value contained within the node (car or first) 
	2. next <- a pointer to the next node within the linked list (cdr or rest) 
6. Methods/Operations 
	1. Insertion() 
		1. Insertion at the beginning is just making the .next pointer for the newNode equal to the current head of the linked list
	2. Deletion()
6. Traversing the linked list 

# Doubly Linked Lists 
1. Basically the same as singly linked lists, but we also have a new 
instance variable for the Node class: the .prev variable, which allows
us to access the Node before the current Node 
# Implementations of Linked Lists in DSSL2 

Link is one of: 
	- cons { data: Any, next: Link } 
	- None 
struct linkedList: 
	let data 
	let next 

cons( 1, None ) 
cons( 1, cons(2,None) ) 

1. Notes 
cons(None, None) is a list with one element that is equal to "None" 
  1. A list of lists with the empty list as its sole element


# The better vector 
1. Dynamic arrays 
  1. Use vectors as storage, but are able to grow periodically 
    1. Allocates a vector with extra space
    2. Add elements until the vector is full 
    3. Once the vector is full, create a new vector with a greater
    array size and then copy the elements over 
	4. This is basically the vector in C++, the ArrayList in Java,
	and the list in Python
